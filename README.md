## 🌈 About Me

I have earned my bachelor’s degree from Sun Yat-sen University in June, 2025. Majoring in communications engineering, I have established academic interest in intelligent signal processing, wireless sensing and their integration with wireless communications. I am a self-motivated student in the university, and I am interest in all sorts of technologies including embedded systems development, UI design, computer graphics and web applications development, which are not typically relevant with the major.

## 📋 Experience

**Research Assistant - SYSU**

*Aug 1, 2025 - Jan 30, 2026*

As RA, my primary job is to provide framework design and implementation for a joint perspective of integrating the embodied intelligence with wireless communications and sensing. Also I serve as the main coordinator between different research groups to promote cross-domain collaboration.
Moreover, I assist my supervisor and co-supervised junior researchers in their thesis and research.

**Intern Researcher - SYSU**

*Dec 30, 2023 - Jun 24, 2025*

During this internship, I explored the integration of AI and wireless communications. The research included reinforcement learning for wireless resource allocation, differentiable communication system design, joint-channel-source-coding paradigm and spatial implicit neural representation for wireless channel modeling.
